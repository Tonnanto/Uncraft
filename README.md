## How it works
You can hold an item in your main hand and uncraft it by typing the command `/uncraft`.

## Customization
You can **whitelist** or **blacklist** specific items in the `config.yml`.
Just add the item ids to the according list.
Remember to check the `use-whitelist` flag when working with white or blacklists.
